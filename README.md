# 🕒 Digital Clock

A modern, responsive digital clock web application. This project demonstrates core JavaScript skills by displaying the current time with real-time updates and additional customizable features.

-   **Real-Time Updates:** The time updates every second seamlessly.
-   **12/24-Hour Format Toggle:** Switch between AM/PM and military time formats.
-   **Dynamic Styling:** Background or color theme changes based on the time of day (e.g., light days, dark nights).
-   **Date Display:** Shows the current day, month, and year.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** Looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Clean & Modern UI:** A minimalist glassmorphism or neumorphic design.

## 🛠️ Built With

-   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure.
-   **CSS3:** For styling, including Flexbox/Grid for layout and CSS variables for theming.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all logic, using `Date()` object, `setInterval()`, and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 How It Works

The core functionality relies on the JavaScript `Date()` object to get the current time. The `setInterval()` method is used to call a function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to update the time displayed on the page, creating a live effect.
